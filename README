# Introduction
A Python automation script analyzes and collects data using the East Tester ET4510 LCR Meter across a user-defined frequency range.
This script supports user-guided manual switching of measurement parameters, real-time data collection and filtering, impedance visualization, and computation based on sample geometry (default: circular sample).

# Features
1. Creation of Logarithmic Frequency array: Automatically creation analysis range based on user-defined min/max frequency and total number of points.
2. Manual Control of Major/Minor Parameters: The ET4510 does not support changing major/minor measurement parameters via SCPI commands while in REMOTE mode. Therefore, users must 
                                             manually adjust them on the device panel when prompted, but automatically toggles the instrument between LOCAL and REMOTE mode to allow manual input when necessary.
3. Repeat Measurement with Data Filtering: Measures each point 5 times at that frequency and filters outliers using ±2.0 standard deviations.
4. Auto-adjusted Wait Time Based on Frequency: Delay time for data reading depending on the frequency to stabilize frequency generation.
5. Safe Data Saving on Ctrl+C: Interrupting the script saves all collected data up to that point.
6. Impedance Calculations and Automatic graph generation: Computes real (Z') and imaginary (Z'') parts of impedance using Rp and Cp.
                                                          Converts Z' and Z'' into specific resistivity with unit of Ω·mm using user-provided thickness and diameter.
7. Skip Any Major/Minor parameter measurment: Users can choose to skip specific Major or Minor measurements for their convenience.
8. File Name Collision Handling: Warns user and requests new filename if a file with same name already exists.

# Requirements
1. Python 3.7+
2. PySerial
3. NumPy
4. Matplotlib

# Notes and Warnings
1. Ensure the ET4510 device is connected to the correct COM port (default: COM4).
2. Create a folder named Data/ in the same directory to store outputs.
3. Manual switching of Major and Minor parameters is mandatory.
4. Always wait for the prompt to set parameters before pressing Enter. In this step, users can choose to skip specific Major or Minor measurements for their convenience.
5. Do not disconnect the device while the script is running.

# Follow the prompts in the terminal. For each measurement cycle:
1. Enter the frequency range and number of points.
2. Enter the filename.
3. Input the sample geometry.
4. Enter a fixed Minor parameter.
5. Follow instructions to manually configure Major/Minor on device.
6. Optionally skip any parameter.
7. View live output and final plot.

# How to Stop Safely
Press Ctrl+C during execution. Script will save all collected data at that point and exit cleanly.
